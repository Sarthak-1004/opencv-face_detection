**Face Detection using OpenCV**

- This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV. It captures video from a webcam (or video file) and detects faces using Haar Cascade Classifiers, drawing bounding boxes around them.

**Features**

- Real-time face detection via webcam

- Uses Haar Cascade Classifier

- Highlights detected faces with bounding boxes

- Beginner-friendly and extendable for facial recognition or emotion detection

**Requirements**

- Python 3.x

- OpenCV (cv2)

**Install dependencies:**

- pip install opencv-python


**Example Output**

- Detected faces will be displayed with bounding boxes in a live video feed.

**Future Improvements**

- Add facial recognition

- Emotion detection

- Multiple object detection

**License**

- This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
